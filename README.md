# Tevo-Little-Monster---Klipper-SKR-mini-e3-v3

Tevo Little Monster 
SKR Mini E3 V3 running Klipper with SFS 2.0 Filament Runout Sensor

After many years of being idle, I decided to relive my old Tevo Little Monster. 
I decided to replace the noisy MKR SBASE v1.3 with an easy-to-find SKR Mini E3 V3 board. Everything else including the extruder and 3dtouch is kept stock.

https://github.com/kizza42/TevoLittleMonster was helpful as a starting point for my config, but I needed to edit some of gcode commands as it no longer works with a newer version of klipper.

Please note that this is a work in progress as I'm not yet able to print anything out yet.
